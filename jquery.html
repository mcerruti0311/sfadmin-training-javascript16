    <h3><a href="#">What jQuery UI Is All About</a></h3>
    <div>
      <p>The jQuery development team decided to launch an “official” collection of
      plug-ins for jQuery, bringing together a wide range of popular user
      interface components and giving them a common interface style. Using these
      components you can build highly interactive and attractively styled web
      applications with a minimum of code.</p>

      <p>Using jQuery UI in your programs gives you access to</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interactions—The jQuery UI library provides support for dragging and
           dropping, resizing, selecting, and sorting page elements.</li>
        <li>Widgets—These are feature-rich controls including accordion,
          autocomplete, button, date picker, dialog, progress bar, slider, and
          tabs.</li>
        <li>Theme building—Give your site a coherent look-and-feel across all of
           the user interface components. A ThemeRoller tool is available at
           http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/. The ThemeRoller online tool allows
           you to choose a theme from the gallery of prewritten designs or
           create a custom theme based on an existing theme as a starting point.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In this hour, you see how to use a selection of the more popular
        plug-ins. Thanks to the consistent user interface of jQuery UI, it will
        then be easy to explore the many other available plug-ins by using the
        jQuery documentation.</p>
